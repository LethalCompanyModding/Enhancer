    Don't mess with anything below this line, it is required to build via 
    github actions. If you are referencing other DLLs in your project than the
    base game or unity DLLs they will need to be available via NUGET or copied
    directly into your repo (which is pretty bad form) to build properly unless
    they already exist on github in which case you can use submodules to track
    the reference instead.

      When adding additional references, ensure you use <Private>false</Private> to
      ensure the DLL is explicitly NOT copied to the output directory. This is because
      the DLLs are already included in the game and will be loaded from there.

      Further, if the DLL is not included as part of the game, you should be using a
      Dependency in your thunderstore.toml file to ensure the DLL is available to the
      game when your mod is loaded.
